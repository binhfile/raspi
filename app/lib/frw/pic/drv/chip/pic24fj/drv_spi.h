/**
 * struct spi_ioc_transfer - describes a single SPI transfer
 * @tx_buf: Holds pointer to userspace buffer with transmit data, or null.
 *	If no data is provided, zeroes are shifted out.
 * @rx_buf: Holds pointer to userspace buffer for receive data, or null.
 * @len: Length of tx and rx buffers, in bytes.
 * @speed_hz: Temporary override of the device's bitrate.
 * @bits_per_word: Temporary override of the device's wordsize.
 * @delay_usecs: If nonzero, how long to delay after the last bit transfer
 *	before optionally deselecting the device before the next transfer.
 * @cs_change: True to deselect device before starting the next transfer.
 *
 * This structure is mapped directly to the kernel spi_transfer structure;
 * the fields have the same meanings, except of course that the pointers
 * are in a different address space (and may be of different sizes in some
 * cases, such as 32-bit i386 userspace over a 64-bit x86_64 kernel).
 * Zero-initialize the structure, including currently unused fields, to
 * accommodate potential future updates.
 *
 * SPI_IOC_MESSAGE gives userspace the equivalent of kernel spi_sync().
 * Pass it an array of related transfers, they'll execute together.
 * Each transfer may be half duplex (either direction) or full duplex.
 *
 *	struct spi_ioc_transfer mesg[4];
 *	...
 *	status = ioctl(fd, SPI_IOC_MESSAGE(4), mesg);
 *
 * So for example one transfer might send a nine bit command (right aligned
 * in a 16-bit word), the next could read a block of 8-bit data before
 * terminating that command by temporarily deselecting the chip; the next
 * could send a different nine bit command (re-selecting the chip), and the
 * last transfer might write some register values.
